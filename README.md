# learnandhelp
Learn and Help:  Learn programming and help different causes.

--[1] What classes are being offered?
--[2] What are the different causes being supported?
--[3] Ability for the school admins (or volunteers) to manage their own space in this portal.
--[4] Ability to provide info on all the schools supported by this program.
--[5] Ability for the students / parents to register for the classes.

--[6] CRUD of books
--[7] Depending upon the grade level (1-5; 6 to 8; or 6 to 10; 1 to 8), this initiative will select a bunch of books (600 to 1000 books) and ship those books to the schools.

-- Give me all 'elementary school' books (that is already in place)
-- sometimes, we may run out of books. Or we might add a new book. Or we might drop some books from the collection. So, we need the ability to precisely select a collection of books destined for a specific school.

[8] Based on the precise selection, we want to produce a final HTML page (which I can use to print a PDF) showing the list of books along with the images, book name, cost. The report should also list the total number of books and the total price at the top of the page. We also need to list the sender (which will not change; So, this comes from a PREFERENCE) and the school (this changes for every report we generate and hence this will be user input on the form).

Admin --> Generate a School/Book Report --> Input the School ID 
      --> and hit "preview"
      --> provide the ability to drop some books from the selection
      --> and hit "Generate" to create the final report for printing.

[9] (Stretch goal) Ability to store final reports on the server.
